An economic vegetarian is a person who practices vegetarianism from either 
the philosophical viewpoint that the consumption of meat is too expensive 
or as part of a conscious simple living strategy. In the developing world 
impoverished people who might not be averse to eating meat are unable to 
because meat can be a luxury. Economic vegetarians believe nutrition can 
be acquired just as, and even more, efficiently through plants than from meat 
at a reduced cost. They argue a vegetarian diet is rich in vitamins, dietary 
fiber, and complex carbohydrates, and carries with it fewer risks (such as 
heart disease, obesity, and bacterial infection) than consumption of by-products 
of animals. Consequently, they consider the production of meat economically unsound.
