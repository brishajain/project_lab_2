A gravity hill, also known as a magnetic hill, mystery hill, mystery spot, 
gravity road, or anti-gravity hill, is a place where the layout of the surrounding
 land produces an illusion, making a slight downhill slope appear to be an uphill 
 slope. Thus, a car left out of gear will appear to be rolling uphill against 
 gravity.[1] Although the slope of gravity hills is an illusion,[2] sites 
 are often accompanied by claims that magnetic or supernatural forces are at work.
The most important factor contributing to the illusion is a completely or mostly 
obstructed horizon. Without a horizon, it becomes difficult for a person to 
judge the slope of a surface, as a reliable reference point is missing, and 
misleading visual cues can adversely affect the sense of balance. Objects 
which one would normally assume to be more or less perpendicular to the 
ground, such as trees, may be leaning, offsetting the visual reference.
