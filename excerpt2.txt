As one of the most iconic and recognizable structures in the world, 
the Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, has been the inspiration for the creation 
of over 50 similar towers around the world. Most are not exact replicas, 
though there are many that resemble it closely, while others look slightly different. 
The Eiffel Tower has also inspired other towers that are not close resembling 
replicas and therefore are not listed here, for example the Blackpool Tower.
