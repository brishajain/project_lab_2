Competitive eating, or speed eating, is a sport in which participants compete 
against each other to eat large quantities of food, usually in a short time period.
Contests are typically eight to ten minutes long, although some competitions can 
last up to thirty minutes, with the person consuming the most food being declared 
the winner. Competitive eating is most popular in the United States, Canada, and 
Japan, where organized professional eating contests often offer prizes, including 
cash. The type of food used in contests varies greatly, with each contest 
typically only using one type of food (e.g. a hot dog eating contest). 
Foods used in professional eating contests include hamburgers, hot dogs, 
pies, pancakes, chicken wings, asparagus, stinging nettles, pizza, ribs, whole 
turkeys, among many other types of food. Foods can reflect local cultures, such 
as vegan hot dogs in Austin, Texas.
