Null Island is the location at zero degrees latitude and zero degrees 
longitude (0°N 0°E), i.e., where the prime meridian and the equator intersect. 
Since there is no landmass located at these coordinates, it is not an actual 
island. The name is often used in mapping software as a placeholder to help 
find and correct database entries that have erroneously been assigned the 
coordinates 0,0. Although "Null Island" started as a joke within the geospatial 
community, it has become a useful means of addressing a recurring issue in 
geographic information science.
