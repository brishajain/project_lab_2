Chipmunks are classified as four genera: Tamias, of which the eastern chipmunk (T. striatus) is the only living member; Eutamias, of which the Siberian chipmunk (E. sibiricus) is the only living member; Nototamias, which consists of three extinct species, and Neotamias, which includes the 23 remaining, mostly western North American, species. These classifications were treated as subgenera due to the chipmunks' morphological similarities.[1] As a result, most taxonomies over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks into a single genus.[2] Joseph C. Moore reclassified chipmunks to form the subtribe Tamiina within the tribe Marmotini in a 1959 study,[3] and this classification of three living genera of chipmunks rather than a single chipmunk genus has been supported by studies of mitochondrial DNA performed from 2000 to 2010.[4]
